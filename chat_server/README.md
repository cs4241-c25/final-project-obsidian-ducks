# chat_server

## Hello Grader

Hello person whos grading our project I hope youve enjoyed our code so far it took a lot of work from the entire team.
granted most of it was andy,mia,theresa, and colin cause Nick(the writer of this read me) went on a side quest.

I wanted to add this read to give you some context as to why Nick decided to add a second language to the project
It was mostly because Nick had done a lot of reaction from ta work and other projects and wanted to do something different
So Nick dusted off their backend skills and tried to create a chat server that could scale.
In theory, this should be it(I still need to load test more).
However, to create a chat server that could scale, Nick decided not to use JavaScript because JavaScript is bad at scale, and in theory, this language is better.

## importent note from nick

im sorry I didnt ask for permission first to use this language first I got excited to do somthing new and got carried away.
If your going to take points away from anyone please take them only from me(nick) as this was soly my idea and the others worked ready hard.
