# WPI Buys
*This web application was created by Team Obsidian Ducks for the final project in CS4241 at WPI. The team includes Theresa Acheampong, Mia Frattasio, Nicholas Leslie, Colin Nguyen, and Andy Truong.*

For our final project, we created an ecommerce platform for WPI students to swap, sell, and buy second-hand items. The platform is called *WPIBuys*. All logos and icons representing WPIBuys were created by the team. Our application was designed to allow users to easily buy and sell items from other WPI students.

## Technology Stack
The application was built using Next.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Gleam for development and Fly for deployment.
- *Next.js*: A full-stack framework that allows developers to build client-side and server-side programs in the same project.
- *MongoDB*: A NoSQL database that stores data in documents, which are stored in collections.
- *TypeScript*: An extension of the JavaScript language that provides type annotations, allowing for JavaScript to behave like a compiled language.
- *Gleam*: A functional programming language which the team used to build the WebSocket server for the application's live messaging feature.
- *Fly*: A platform for deploying web applications.

## Features
The key features of our application include: 
1. User authentication with NextAuth
2. Item Listings
3. Search & Filtering
4. Live Messaging
5. Responsive Design
